# Welcome to Dux Lang
An experimental new programming language

Why do you create another programming language?
	1. We like of new challanges;
	2. Why not?
	3. We saw a lot of pragram languages with crazy syntax sugars but.. really?
	4. Out aim is to create a fusion between the elegance of Python and 
	   the strenght of C++ without so much crazy syntax (just a little bit :D)
	5. Compiled! Yeahhh \nn/_

Anyone that want to help and code well will be awesome :)
